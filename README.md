Git Repository for PH2_DAQ Software
===================================


Supposed to contain:

- A middleware API layer, implemented in C++, which will basically wrap
to abstracted functions the firmware calls and handshakes currently
hardcoded into DAQ systems software.

- A C++ object-based library describing the system components (CBCs,
Hybrids, Boards) and their properties(values, status)



MCP Test Interface
------------------

Here are the step to make the program functional

1. Recover the GitHub repo with the latest tested version of the MCP.

2. Change in HWDescription/Definition.h the path to the uHal connection file.
   - It's per default set to :
   file:///afs/cern.ch/user/n/npierre/dev/settings/connections.xml
   - You have to change it to :
   file://$(BUILD)/settings/connections.xml (where $(BUILD) is the path to the
   root of the GitHub repo you recovered)

3. Change in settings/connections.xml the path to the adress table
   - It's per default set to :
   file:///afs/cern.ch/user/n/npierre/dev/settings/adress_table.xml
   - You have to change it to :
   file://$(BUILD)/settings/adress_table.xml (where $(BUILD) is the path to the
   root of the GitHub repo you recovered)

4. Do a make in the root the repo (make sure you have all uHal, root, boost... libraries on your computer)

5. Launch testpgrm command if you want to test if everything is working good

6. Launch mcp to play with the Test Interface


What can you do with the software ?
-----------------------------------

A Glib is created per default (maybe in the future you will be able to play with more than one Glib)

You can then add Modules to the Glib and Cbcs to the Modules you created.
When creating a Cbc, you can choose the config file you will load to its
register map.
If you want to add your personal config file, please make sure to add it in #define
in the HWDescription/Description.h and then to add an option in the MCP code.

After this creation round, you can do anything you want :
- Configure the Glib or the Cbcs
- Manipulate the registers in the Glib
- Manipulate the registers in the Cbcs
- Do the manipulation to Start/Stop an acquisition, but not actually acquiring something relevant
- Have a configuration recap of all the objects you created

Concerning the manipulation of the Cbcs, you have the opportunity to modify all the
Cbcs of a same Module at once with the Broadcast feature of the Cbc.

When you write a register in the Glib or the Cbc, the writing is updated to the
map contained in Glib/Cbc objects so that you're always fully aware of what is
in the Glib/Cbc register.

For writing value in register, we invite you to put in the following format : 0x__.
You must thus type '0xFF' for exemple and not just 'FF' in the command line. That
might change in the future..

At the end of the program, the register maps are saved into output_X_X.txt files
you can find in the settings directory. For example, output_1_2.txt contains the
register map of the Cbc 2 of the Module 1.

More features will be implemented later, so make sure to have the last release
locally to benefit from them.

Warning ! : be careful with options choice in the program menus, some mistypes can leed
to unexpected hazards :-(.

Last Updates
------------

- 09/07/14 : Added threading for stack writing registers
- 10/07/14 : Read Data from acquisition in a rubbish format
- ~~25/07/14 : Fully functional for 2CBC (safe from Broadcast obviously), pending for 8CBC~~
- 30/07/14 : Working 8CBC version with latest firmware

Future Improvements
-------------------

- Implementation of generic BeBoard and BeBoardInterface Class which will help us
dealing with multiple board type (Glib, FC7).
- Work on the Cbc class to make it recognize if the Cbc is from a Glib or a FC7.
- Implement the new Strasbourg firmware as soon as it comes out.
